# Teaching a humanoid to walk

The aim of this project is to teach a 
humanoid in a controlled environment to walk using reinforcement learning.

To do this I'm using the gym environment : [Humanoid-v5](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/humanoid/)

Using the advanced physics engine: [Mujoco](http://www.mujoco.org/)
